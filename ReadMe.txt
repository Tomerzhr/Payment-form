Welcome dear visitor,
The next project is a credit card project which was created using Html, Javascript, Css.
This is a simple Javascript project that illustrates entering credit information and all this with the help of an accessible and intuitive design for the user.
The project contains validations that the user enters and thus moves him to the next field.
I hope you will be impressed by my project and with any questions do not hesitate to contact me through my portfolio website.
